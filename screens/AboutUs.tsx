        Water Contamination Risks
      </Text>

      <Text style = {{fontSize: 16 , marginBottom:16 , color:'#374151'}}>
        Chances are the water you use is safe, but millions have found out too
        late that is not the case. Just one sip of water contaminated with
        pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites, can cause severe
        illness in a matter of hours. Yet, still today, a conventional lab
        requires 24 - 48 hours to report analyses of samples that may only be
        taken weekly, or less.

        In <Text style = {{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Milwaukee (1993)</Text>, 400,000 residents
        were made ill and 100 died due to drinking water contaminated with
        cryptosporidium. Residents in <Text style = {{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Hoosick Falls</Text> and{" "}
        <Text style = {{fontWeight:'bold'}}>Newburgh, NY</Text> were exposed to highly
        toxic PFAS and may have been for years without knowing it.

        Water contamination is endemic across the planet, making hundreds of
        millions of people ill, including tens of millions in the United States.
        The best defense against this threat are innovations that enable{" "}
        <Text style = {{fontWeight:'bold'}}>real-time</Text>, technological detection of
        water contaminants before they can reach our taps or recreational
